### DidItBetter Referral Program

Our Affiliate Referral Agent program is for anyone who refers customers to our
web store to purchase. For every user who makes a purchase, you receive 5% of
the pre-tax total price. We handle the customer relationship thereafter.

As a DidItBetter Referral Agent, you’re eligible for these benefits:

- Named account manager - Every affiliate referral agent has an inside advocate you can contact with questions on licensing and support options. We conduct joint sync system planning with partners to help you accomplish smoother migrations and lower sync system management and support costs.
- Revenue generation - Our affiliate referral agents generate revenue for each customer to whom they send cart links which result in completed purchases. To directly support the end users so you don’t have to, we offer several value bundles which include at least 4 hours of Premier Support in addition to 1-, 2-, or 3 years of software assurance with email support. Or if you have a direct customer support relationship and prefer to handle that aspect of it yourself, no problem, we work that way as well.
- 5% referral reward  - For each customer referred who orders online from your store cart links, you earn 5% of the entire sale price of our software and services (less taxes and promotions). There are no restrictions or blacked-out products. Sell ‘license only’ options with or without Premier Support or recommend any of our popular Value Bundles with tools, software assurance, and a block of Premier Support for remote/phone support assistance with one of our techs. End users with Premier Support in place benefit from a ‘hands on’ approach to tech support via scheduled remote sessions and experience a faster response time than basic email support.
- Repeat business strengthens your customer relationships, builds customer loyalty, and helps you earn you more referral rewards. Many of our customers end up providing recurring revenue opportunities and make use of the myriad use cases made possible with our software.  Sell more user licenses, add-on products, crossgrades, or support services and earn a 5% reward on converted sales from your store carts.
- Sales and technical training included - We personally train each referral partner on our licensing model, software assurance programs, and available support options.  Training is remote and interactive to maximize learning. Each session is dedicated to you and your company so you can ask whatever questions you need, whether you are twenty salespeople on your team or one.
- Free trial software - Our software comes with a free 21-day fully functional trial for your referrals to evaluate before making a purchasing decision. After training with us and once you install the trial version, you’ll be able to get your referrals engaged in our products for proof of concept so they as users can experience first-hand how the product works and how it meets their software needs. You can focus on getting them excited about other challenges our software can solve for them rather than having to convince them to make a purchase based on faith or price alone. 
- Marketing collateral - Email and printable materials for market development efforts are available to help spark product awareness and generate interest. Most materials are brandable and may be personalized with your contact information.
