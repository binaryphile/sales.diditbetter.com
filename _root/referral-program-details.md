How the Referral Program Works
==============================

**DidItBetter Software solutions complement and add functionality to
your Microsoft Exchange, Microsoft Outlook, Microsoft Office and mobile
devices!**

Thank you for your recommending our DidItBetter.com Software solutions
and welcome the opportunity to work with you in introducing our
innovative solutions to your clients. We invite you to join the
DidItBetter.com Affiliate Referral Agent team.

Our company has been in business since 1988 and as the pioneer of
Exchange public folder and Outlook folder synchronization products; we
have developed and enhanced our sync solutions over the last decade to
meet our customers' changing sync needs in the workplace and on the go.
We offer server-side (Add2Exchange), client-side (Add2Outlook) and a
hosted sync solution (hosted Exchange + hosted Add2Exchange). Because
every company is not structured the same, our solutions were designed to
handle multiple sync scenarios allowing our customers to tailor
Add2Exchange to meet their sync needs. For mobile device and smartphone
users, our sync solutions benefit those who want to synchronize Exchange
public folders to the personal folder which is where it needs to be in
order for the mobile device's sync software to get to it.

Consider our solutions if you are an IT consultant, value added
provider, or network/systems integrator who recommends or supports
Microsoft Exchange, Outlook, Office products, mobile devices, BES, and
have clients who would benefit from:

* Helpful, centralized, easy-to-use Microsoft Exchange / Outlook Add Ins
  for Outlook folder synchronization of calendars, contacts, tasks,
  posts or have a need for Active Directory GAL Sync.
* Exchange public folder sync solutions for mobile and any Smartphone
  users (for example, iPhone, iPad, Androids, Blackberry).
* Server-based and centralized folder creation and management solutions
  to clone Outlook folders.
* Group/interoffice task management and team collaboration solutions.
* CRM: Simple Contact and Lead Management and Marketing Solutions for
  Microsoft Office users.

Go to the [signup process].  Once you've been approved and configured in
our system, follow these instructions to begin sending referrals.

**Whenever you work with referrals, you'll need to be logged into your
account.**

Note, you will not be able to see any of the referral functionality
on the site until your account has been enabled and the following
screens will help you familiarize yourself with the new functionality
you will see on the store.diditbetter.com site.

##### Referrals

Your prospects are your prospects and we will not try to contact them
directly. The only way we would contact them is if they call in to our
company to ask questions. If they do call in, we will ask if they are
working with one of our referral partners to include you in the
conversation.

The easiest way to find a product page is through the [product
descriptions] on our main site.

Each product has a purchase button which will take you to the
appropriate page or category on the store.

When you know what product and options you want the customer purchase,
click the *Add To Cart* button.   Once you have all of the products you
want in the cart, click the *Cart* link to view the cart contents.

![Cart Referral]{: width="349" height="207" style="float: right;"}

In the cart, review your contents and make any final changes.  At the
bottom is the *Send Referral* button. To send the cart to a lead, click
the button. Your email client will open to compose the email. The
message subject and body will be filled out with some basic information.
You can craft the message however you like, adding the recipient in the
*To* field as well. When you're ready, go ahead and send it.

You can send the same message to one or many recipients. If you do not
want multiple recipients to see each other's contact information, just
use the Bcc field.

To make sure we have record that your prospect is your prospect for any
eventual sale, the referral email message can automatically Bcc
referral@diditbetter.com so you get credit when they use your referral
link for the sale. If you download a trial for the customer, be sure to
specify your company as the IT so our automatic drip campaign does not
activate.

Remember to empty the *To* field of its default "Friend" contents in
either case and replace it with your customer's email address.

![Email]{: width="606" height="272"}
{: style="text-align: center;"}

Included in the email body is the link to the contents of the cart. The
link carries your email encoded within it so your account is associated
with any order which results from ordering using this link.

When the lead visits the link from their computer, your referral email
address will be attached to any order they make. Even if they end up
choosing to purchase a different product, you will still be listed as
the Affiliate Referral Agent.

There are two situations where your email will be cleared from that
lead. The first is if they click a different referral link, one which
contains a different referral partner. The second is if they clear their
browser cache before purchase, or if they purchase from a different
computer. While there is a chance either of these situations could
arise, they won't happen in the normal course of business. Optionally,
if you utilize the automatic bcc to our email, we will be able to give
you the credit for the referral sale as long as the the customer does
not select a different referral partner.

It is helpful to keep track of your referrals who purchase and to verify
our site shows the same purchases.

##### Viewing Your Completed Referrals

![Your account]{: width="289" height="67" style="float: right;"}

When a customer completes an order which lists you as a Referral Agent,
the order becomes available for viewing on your account page.

To view your Store.diditbetter.com account, log into the site and click
*My Account* in the upper right-hand corner.

If you have any completed referrals, there will be a section listing
them called *My Referrals*.

You can click on their order numbers for more details.

Above it is the section which lists any orders you yourself have
completed, called *My Orders*.

These are orders you have purchased from your account, for your account.
This section would list what you have purchased for yourself or for
resale. This section should not be confused with your referrals.

##### Payment for your Completed Referrals

Once a month we will tally your completed referral orders and send you a
check.
