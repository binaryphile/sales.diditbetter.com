**DidItBetter Software solutions complement and add functionality to
your Microsoft Exchange, Microsoft Outlook, Microsoft Office and mobile
devices!**

Thank you for your recommending our DidItBetter Software solutions and
welcome the opportunity to work with you in introducing our innovative
solutions to your clients. We invite you to join the DidItBetter
Software Affiliate Referral team.

Our company has been in business since 1988 and as the pioneer of
Exchange public folder and Outlook folder synchronization products; we
have developed and enhanced our sync solutions over the last decade to
meet our customers\' changing sync needs in the workplace and on the go.
We offer server-side (Add2Exchange), client-side (Add2Outlook) and a
hosted sync solution (hosted Exchange + hosted Add2Exchange). Because
every company is not structured the same, our solutions were designed to
handle multiple sync scenarios allowing our customers to tailor
Add2Exchange to meet their sync needs. For mobile device and smartphone
users, our sync solutions benefit those who want to synchronize Exchange
public folders to the personal folder which is where it needs to be in
order for the mobile device\'s sync software to get to it.

Consider our solutions if you are an IT consultant, value added
provider, or network/systems integrator who recommends or supports
Microsoft Exchange, Outlook, Office products, mobile devices, BES, and

  for Outlook folder synchronization of calendars, contacts, tasks,
  posts or have a need for Active Directory GAL Sync.

## Getting Started   {#getting-started}

![New Account]({{urls.media}}/new_account.png){: width="175" height="115" style="float:
right;"}

The first thing you will need is to create an account on our
store.diditbetter.com. This is a different log in than the
support.diditbetter.com to enhance your security and separate
administration versus support engineering. The two sites can have the
same log in and password if you register with the same information. For
higher security, we suggest using your company\'s support email account
for support.

Go to [http://store.diditbetter.com/][2] and follow along with these
instructions.

If you have a login, use it to log in. If you don\'t already have a
login:

* Click the *Login* link in the upper right-hand corner of the screen
* At the bottom of the page, click *Create a new account*
* Enter your email and password, then click *Create*

**Whenever you work with referrals, you\'ll need to be logged into your
account.**

Once you have your store.diditbetter.com account set up and have filled
out the Referral application below and furnish the paperwork required to
send you referral checks, we will contact you by the email you have
specified when you are approved as a referral agent. Once approved, you
will be able to use the referral capability with that account and be
able to manage and check the status of the carts which are pending or
have checked out.

Note, you will not be able to see any of the \"referral functionality\"
on the site until your account has been enabled and the following
screens will help you familiarize yourself with the new functionality
you will see on the store.diditbetter.com site.

## Product and Cart Referrals   {#product-and-cart-referrals}

Once you\'re set up, the easiest way to send a referral to a lead is to
visit a particular product page. Your prospects are your prospects and
we will not try to contact them directly. The only way we would contact
them is if they call in to our company to ask questions. If they do call
in, we will ask if they are working with one of our referral partners to
include you in the conversation.

The easiest way to find a product page is through the product
descriptions on our main site at:

[http://www.diditbetter.com/products.aspx][3]

Each product has a purchase button which will take you to the
appropriate page or category on the store.

![Product Referral]({{urls.media}}/product_referral.png){: width="206" height="149"
style="float: right;"}

When you get to the product page you will see the *Send Referral*
button. To send the product to a lead, click the button. Your email
client will open to compose the email. The message subject and body will
be filled out with some basic information. You can craft the message
however you like, adding the recipient in the *To* field as well. When
you\'re ready, go ahead and send it.

You can send the same message to one or many recipients. If you do not
want multiple recipients to see each other\'s contact information, just
use the Bcc field.

To make sure we have record that your prospect is your prospect for any
eventual sale, the Referral email message can automatically Bcc
Referral@diditbetter.com so you get credit when they use your referral
link for the sale. If you download a trial for the customer, be sure to
specify your company as the IT so our automatic drip campaign does not
activate.

Remember to empty the *To* field of its default \"Friend\" contents in
either case and replace it with your customer\'s email address.

![Email]({{urls.media}}/email.png){: width="606" height="272"}
{: style="text-align: center;"}

Included in the email body is the link to the product page. The link
carries your email encoded within it so your account is associated with
any order which results from ordering using this link.

When the lead visits the link from their computer, your Referral email
address will be attached to any order they make. Even if they end up
choosing to purchase a different product, you will still be listed as
the Referral Partner.

There are two situations where your email will be cleared from that
lead. The first is if they click a different referral link, one which
contains a different referral partner. The second is if they clear their
browser cache before purchase, or if they purchase from a different
computer. While there is a chance either of these situations could
arise, they won\'t happen in the normal course of business. Optionally,
if you utilize the automatic Bcc to our email, we will be able to give
you the credit for the referral sale as long as the the customer does
not select a different referral partner.

It is helpful to keep track of your referrals who purchase and to verify
our site shows the same purchases.

Next, we will cover how to verify a customer has completed their order
when we discuss viewing your referrals.

## Sending Cart Referrals   {#sending-cart-referrals}

As well as just sending a referral to a product page, such as the Value
Bundle, you can also preassemble a cart of products to satisfy a
customer\'s needs to make it easier for them to pick and choose what to
buy by adding or removing things from the cart.

Here are the instructions.

![Cart Referral]({{urls.media}}/cart_referral.png){: width="349" height="207"
style="float: right;"}

First, use your login to the site if you haven\'t already.

Then click the cart link in the upper right-hand corner of the page.

Empty your cart of any products you don\'t want to send to the lead.
Then, shop the site as usual, picking the products and options they will
want.

Finally, click the cart button once more to view the cart. Click *Send
Referral*.

Just as sending a Referral link to a product, your email client will
open up with a default subject line and a link in the email body. This
link looks different than just a product because there are more products
in the link, but this link operates in the same fashion.

When the customer completes the order that was sent in the link, you
will be credited as the Referral Agent for that sale.

When the customer clicks the link, any existing contents in their cart
will be cleared (if they\'ve visited the store before) and the contents
of your cart will be there instead. The customer is free to modify the
contents of the cart as they desire, and you will still be credited on
the sale since they clicked your link.

The customer will always receive the cart as it was when you sent it. If
you need to revise the cart for any reason, you need to do so then send
a new link and tell the customer to discard the old one.

## Viewing Your Completed Referrals   {#viewing-your-completed-referrals}

![Your account]({{urls.media}}/your_account.png){: width="289" height="67"
style="float: right;"}

When a customer completes an order which lists you as a Referral Agent,
the order becomes available for viewing on your account page.

To view your Store.diditbetter.com account, log into the site and click
*My Account* in the upper right-hand corner.

If you have any completed referrals, there will be a section listing
them called *My Referrals*.

You can click on their order numbers for more details.

Above it is the section which lists any orders you yourself have
completed, called *My Orders*.

These are orders you have purchased from your account, for your account.
This section would list what you have purchased for yourself or for
resale. This section should not be confused with your referrals.

## Payment for your Completed Referrals   {#payment-for-your-completed-referrals}

Once a month we will tally your completed Referral Orders and send you a
check. Note that we have a very strict licensing policy which means
there are no refunds once an order has been placed or after the keys
have been issued or Premier Remote Support has been rendered by our
team. In the rare instance where there is a chargeback, the Referral
commission for that sale will be charged against other Referral
purchases and the net amount will be given to the Referral Agent.
