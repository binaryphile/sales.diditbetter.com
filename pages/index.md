### Join our Referral Partner or Authorized Resellers Team   {#join-our-referral-partner-or-authorized-resellers-team}

Should you be a reseller or a referral agent? That depends on whether
you want to manage your client relationship directly or whether you want
to refer leads to us and move on to the next customer.

If you are an IT consultant with a long-running relationship with your
customers, check out our authorized reseller program.

If you are a sales-oriented businessperson who excels at finding new
revenue opportunities, check out our referral partner program.

### DidItBetter.com Referral Partner Program   {#referral-program}

Do you recommend our products to your customer base? Would you like to
be compensated when your referrals to our products result in sales? Then
our referral partner program is for you.

As a DidItBetter Certified Referral Partner, you\'re eligible for all of
these benefits:

* **Named account manager** - Every partner has an inside advocate you
  can call anytime to discuss any topic. We conduct joint sync system
  planning with partners to help you accomplish smoother migrations and
  lower sync system management and support costs.
* **Revenue generation** - Our partners generate revenue for each
  customer to whom they send cart links which result in completed
  purchases. We directly support all systems we sell with our software
  assurance program, so you don\'t have to. Or if you have a direct
  customer support relationship and want to handle that aspect of it
  yourself, no problem, we work that way as well.
* **5% margins** - For each order you refer, you get 5% of the entire
  sale price of our software and services (less taxes and promotions).
  There are no restrictions or blacked-out products. Sell software only
  or bundle it with any of our Value Bundles. With Premier Support, we
  use our self-healing technology to recover from common error
  conditions and eliminate lengthy support times to maximize your
  profit.
* **Sales and technical training included** - We personally train each
  referral partner. Training is remote and interactive to maximize
  learning. Each session is dedicated to you and your company so you can
  ask whatever questions you need, whether you are twenty salespeople on
  your team or one.
* **Included technical support** - You\'ll receive customer support from
  certified DidItBetter support engineers, top-notch technical engineers
  with intimate knowledge of Exchange and our products. You\'ll always
  talk to someone who is committed to providing timely solutions to your
  questions and issues. After-hours support is factored into any of our
  Premier Support agreements so you can get a customer\'s issue resolved
  whenever you need.
* **Free trial software** - Our software comes with free 21-day trials.
  After training with us, you\'ll be able to get your customers
  delighted with our products so they can see first-hand how it solves
  their issues without them having to have spent a dime. You can focus
  on getting them excited about what other problems our software can
  solve for them rather than having to convince them to make a purchase
  on faith alone. Many of our customers end up providing recurring
  revenue opportunities and make use of the myriad use cases made
  possible with our software. Sell more user licenses, add-on products
  or services and continue making 5% on these converted opportunities.
* **NFR for your business** - Referral partners receive an unlimited
  Not-For-Resale copy of our flagship product, Add2Exchange Enterprise.
  Familiarize yourself with our products on-demand in your own
  environment and benefit from the same synchronization capabilities
  you\'ll be selling to your customers. Personal testimony to the
  product\'s effectiveness is one of the best ways to establish
  credibility with skeptical potential customers. (NFR copy does not
  count as a sale towards referral credit)
* **Marketing collateral** - Email and printable materials for market
  development efforts are provided to help spark product awareness and
  desire in your customer base. Our materials are brandable and
  personalizable.
