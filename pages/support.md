##### Store login is different than our other sites (www and support)   {#store-login-is-different-than-our-other-sites-www-and-support}

We have recently upgraded our websites and because of these
improvements, our previous registered users may need to create a new
account to log on to the new system for the first time. The login and
signup is located in the upper left hand corner of every page – Try
*Recover Password* first, and if not found, click on [Register][7] to
create your new account which can be used on either the main
Diditbetter.com site and Support.diditbetter.com site.

Please [email
us](&amp;#109;&amp;#097;&amp;#105;&amp;#108;&amp;#116;&amp;#111;:&amp;#105;&amp;#110;&amp;#102;&amp;#111;&amp;#064;&amp;#100;&amp;#105;&amp;#100;&amp;#105;&amp;#116;&amp;#098;&amp;#101;&amp;#116;&amp;#116;&amp;#101;&amp;#114;&amp;#046;&amp;#099;&amp;#111;&amp;#109;)
if you run into any problems when you log on or try to create your new
account.

##### Important security changes to protect your store account   {#important-security-changes-to-protect-your-store-account}

To increase your account security, we have now require two separate
logins and passwords, one for the Store and one for our DidItBetter.com
and Support.diditbetter.com sites. These are two separate registrations,
but the username and password can be the same, if you wish.

Your DidItBetter.com Login (and support.diditbetter.com) provides access
to the Downloads area and to post on our support site’s Forums.

* The store login is for purchasing from our secure online store and to
  track referrals. When placing your order on our online store or to
  send Referral Carts, if you have not logged in already, you will be
  prompted to log in or create an online store account to ensure your
  account security.

Again, both sites can have the same login and password if you create the
accounts with the same information, however, they do not have to be
identical and to increase your account security, we suggest having two
separate logins and passwords. This feature allows for your technical
contacts to have one support account for the Downloads area and Support
Forums, and for your buyer or Referral Agent to have a Purchasing
account to place orders, check Referral Cart statuses and access
purchase history on our secure online store.

Please make note of the email address you use for both login credentials
and select your own unique Display Name for the avatar in the Forums. If
you forget your credentials, you can then use the “Recover Password”
option to recover it, and please remember to use your EMAIL address
moving forward.
