### DidItBetter Reseller Program

Our Authorized Reseller Program is for IT managed services providers who
would like to purchase product at a discounted price and resell to their
customers at our regular list price. As an authorized reseller, your
company is the designated primary contact for the licensed end user
company you resold to.  As the authorized reseller, you also handle the
support relationship with the end user. As the manufacturer of the
software, we require the authorized reseller to provide us  the end
user's complete contact information for our licensing records.

**Unlock New Revenue Opportunities!** If you are an IT professional with
