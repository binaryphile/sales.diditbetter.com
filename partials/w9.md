## Provide Materials   {#provide-materials}

Completing your registration requires us to have a completed W9 on file
so we can make payments to you or your company. Since this is an IRS
form, it must be downloaded and sent to us either by fax (813-972-7986)
or scanned into a PDF and emailed to us at
PartnerPrograms@diditbetter.com.

You won\'t be able to make referrals until your account has been enabled
to do so.  You will be notified via email once the materials have been
reviewed.  Thank you for your patience.
